     <h2>CSS</h2>
     Cascading Style Sheet ( English : Cascading Style Sheet ) is a style language ( English : Style sheet language [ * ] ) that describes how markup language is actually displayed [1] , HTML and Mainly used in XHTML , but can also be used in XML . It is a W3C standard, and has a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style . The default file name [2] is style.css.

If the markup language (ex: HTML ) is in charge of the body of the website, CSS can be said to be in charge of decoration, like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website by leaving the HTML structure the same and changing the CSS file .

In the case of CSS3, which is currently under development, functions that can replace images created with graphic editing programs, such as shadow effects, gradients , and transformations, have been added. In addition, various animation functions have been added, and it is replacing Adobe Flash to some extent.
